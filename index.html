  <h3>April 18th 1956 - December 30th 2022</h3>
  <p class="obituary">Rouky Martin: 66, led a fruitful life until his untimely passing in his home in
    December 2022.
    <br><br>
    Born on April 18, 1956 in Newport News, Virginia, Rouky was the oldest of four
    children born to Rufus Martin and Christine Martin-Heath. Shortly after his birth,
    his parents moved with him to Brooklyn, New York where he was raised.
    <br><br>
    Rouky studied computer programming at The City College of New York where he
    earned his Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. Early on in his career, Rouky
    went on to work for Telcordia (Bellcore), AT&T and Lucent. He continued to work for
    several companies as a senior software developer and engineer until retirement.
    While at Telcordia, Rouky found time to volunteer at the PACE program helping
    middle and high school students learn about computers on weekends. He also
    taught as an adjunct professor at Middlesex County College and other online
    schools.
    <br><br>
    Besides his love of learning new things and computers, Rouky was a wonderful Dad
    and greatly loved his children. They were his heart, his pride, and his joy. He was
    very active in their lives and spent as much quality time with them as possible,
    taking pictures or video at every chance. Jazz was also a big part of Rouky’s life.
    He enjoyed attending annual jazz festivals and even traveled to South Africa with
    the WBGO jazz station in 2019. In retirement, Rouky still found time to substitute
    teach, try new foods, volunteer in his neighborhood, travel and take long hikes in
    nature where he took many pictures of animals and flowers.
    <br><br>
    Rouky was pre-deceased by his parents Christine Martin-Heath, Rufus Martin, step-father Charles Heath, aunt Irene Scott, and uncles John Jr. and David Nathaniel
    Hayes, as well as his best friend Donald Moore.
    <br><br>

    Martin of NJ; son Amaad Martin, and step-children Tiburtius "junior" Roberts and
    Felicidad Hughes (Lance) of NJ; his brothers, Anthony Martin Sr. (Janet) of NY;
